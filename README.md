## Course Structure

(Note this is currently incomplete - updates follow)

### I. Fundamentals - Linear Algebra based on (MIT 18.06) by Gilbert Strang
Gilbert Strang's lectures of which this section is based on can be seen here: www..com<br>
This segment gives you the fundamentals required for the ML sections. This will involve linear algebra, matrix multiplications, vector spaces etc...

```
A1 = Linear Algebra<br>
A2 = Linear Algebra<br>
A3 = Factorization into A = LU<br>
--
B1 = Linear Algebra<br>
B2 = Linear Algebra<br>
B3 = Factorization into A = LU<br>
```
### II. Convolutional Neural Networks fundamentals - Stanford cs221n by Fei-Fei Li & Justin Johnson

```
B1 = Optimisation functions
```
### IV.
### V.
### VI.
### VII.
### VIII.
### IX.
### X.
### XI.

```
B1 = Optimisation functions
```
